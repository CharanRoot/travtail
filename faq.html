									What is Travtail?
								</h2>
								<p>
									Travtail builds intelligent vending platforms for the world’s on-demand economy. Our products enable customers to get essential products right now, not tomorrow or next week. We are building the world's biggest vending platform.</p>
							</div>
							
							<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">
									How do I sign up?
								</h2>
								<p>
									Visit <a href="https://travtail.squarespace.com/stores" target="_blank"> travtail stores </a>to pre-order our stores or send us an email at contact@travtail.com.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">
									How will you know when I need new products?
								</h2>
								<p>
									We are constantly analyzing each store to identify potential stockouts, high turnover items and several other data points and can predict with almost 100% accuracy when you’ll need new products. If you are selling Travtail Products, we will ensure they are delivered to you on time. If you are buying your own products, we will give you access to several tools to plan for stockouts and manage your inventory. Our partners can give you discounts on wholesale purchases to reload your store - you have access to these discounts for free.</p>
							</div>
							
							<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">
									How will I receive products?
								</h2>
								<p>
									We will ship the products to your desired location (this only applies to select locations). If you are selling your own products, you can buy products to reload your store whenever you want but we will provide you with several tools to make sure you don't run out of stock.</p>
							</div>
							
							<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">
									How much money can I make?
								</h2>
								<p>
									You can make $200-$10000/month. Average sellers can make $200-$500/machine a month selling products. Top sellers can make $600-$1000/machine a month selling products. If you sell high value products or buy the bigger stores, you can make up to $10K a month</p>
							</div>
							
										
							<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">
									Which locations are you in?
								</h2>
								<p>
									Soon, we will be piloting in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Atlanta and Nashville. We will be expanding to more locations in the US in the next 12 months. For other questions, please email us at contact@travtail.com. Visit <a href="https://travtail.squarespace.com/stores" target="_blank"> travtail stores </a>to pre-order our stores.</p>
							</div>
							
							<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">
									How many stores can I have?
								</h2>
								<p>
									You can have as many stores as you need. If your short term rental property, rideshare, apartment complex, hotel or any other location gets a lot of traffic, we recommend putting our stores in multiple locations - we have stores of different sizes and shapes to accomodate the unique needs of each location. For rideshare drivers, you can have up to three stores in your car - one between the front passenger and driver seat, one behind the passenger seat and another behind the driver seat. All stores are completely self-service - put the store anywhere and continue with your normal activities.</p>
							</div>
						<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">
									Is it possible that the inventory shown on the phone isn't the same as the inventory in the machine? What happens if someone buys something and turn out not to be physically available?
								</h2>
								<p> Our vending machines are designed such that only the products that are available in the physical vending machines are available for purchase in our mobile application. We also track available units in real-time - a product will immediately not be available for purchase once the on-hand units are sold. When this happens, we immediately notify the vending machine owner that they need to replenish the vending machine.</p>
							</div>
						<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">
									What if someone accidentally grabs 2 items but paid for just 1 item? What happens if the customer puts the second item back?
								</h2>
								<p>
									Our algorithm accounts for these types of edge scenarios - customer selects one item and picks 2, customer selects two items and picks 1, customer's credit card is no longer active, customer takes one or more items and puts them back etc.</p>
							</div>
						<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">
									What if a customer puts an item in there that doesn’t belong or in the wrong section?
								</h2>
							<p>If a customer puts items in the wrong section or puts an item that was never in the store, we will notify the store owner to place the item back in the right compartment or remove the item, and charge or penalize the customer as needed. Note that for most models, only the compartments with the product that the customer selects opens up. However, we know exactly where the item is and will charge any other customer that picks the item.</p>
									
						</div>
						<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">
									What if a customer misunderstands and pays for one item but thinks they paid for all the items they grabbed?
								</h2>
								<p>Our algorithm accounts for this. In this case, the customer will be notified that they will be charged for all the items they grabbed. If the customer proceeds with the transaction, they will get charged. If they return the items (including putting the items in the wrong compartments), they will not be charged.

									What if a customer damages other products?
								</h2>
							<p>If a customer damages the product and it is reported by the store owner with evidence, we will charge the customer. For unmanned locations, this is definitely a risk that we continue to develop/explore solutions for including offering theft, loss, damage insurance etc. </p>
						</div>
						<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">
									How do you handle defective/damaged products?

						</div>
							
							<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">
									How do you handle the vending machine malfunctioning and not allowing the customer to grab what they paid for?
								</h2>
								<p>
									We (and the vending machine owner) have the ability to remotely troubleshoot the vending machine. If the vending machine still refuses to work after troubleshooting, we will send a repair partner to the vending machine location.
								</p>
						</div>
							
							<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">
									How do you handle vending machine owners who try to cheat their customers, sell expired products, try to sell illegal items etc.?
								</h2>
								<p>
								We will investigate any reported product defects/damages and penalized the store owners based on our terms of service. Customers will be fully refunded.
								</p>
						</div>
						<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">
									What types of products can I sell?
								</h2>
								<p>
									In general, you can sell any product. As part of our onboarding, we will give you access to our product ideas training - this training will give you insights into high demand products based on where, when and how you plan to sell your products. To suggest a new product offering, send us a message via the contact us page or send an email to contact@travtail.com. </p>
