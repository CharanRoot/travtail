								<p style="text-align:left"> These Terms of Service constitute a legally binding agreement (the “Agreement”) between you and Travtail Technologies, Inc., its parents, subsidiaries, representatives, affiliates, officers and directors (collectively, “Travtail,” “we,” “us” or “our”) governing your use of the Travtail application, website, and technology platform (collectively, the “Travtail Platform”).</p>
						<p style="text-align:left">PLEASE BE ADVISED: THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS PROVISIONS THAT GOVERN HOW CLAIMS BETWEEN YOU AND TRAVTAIL CAN BE BROUGHT (SEE SECTION 17 BELOW). THESE PROVISIONS WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRE YOU TO SUBMIT CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST TRAVTAIL TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS, GROUP OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. AS A DRIVER OR DRIVER APPLICANT, YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN CLAIMS AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 17.</p>	
						<p style="text-align:left">By entering into this Agreement, and/or by using or accessing Travtail’s applications you expressly acknowledge that you understand this Agreement (including the dispute resolution and arbitration provisions in Section 17) and accept all of its terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE TRAVTAIL PLATFORM OR ANY OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH THE TRAVTAIL PLATFORM. If you use the Travtail Platform in another country, you agree to be subject to Travtail's terms of service for that country.</p>
						<h2 class="text-uppercase"> 
						The Travtail Platform<br>
								</h2>
						<p style="text-align:left">The Travtail Platform provides a marketplace where persons who seek services(“Customers”) can be matched with service providers who provide the services. One option for Customers is to request a service from persons who are nearby (“Service Providers”). Service Providers and Customers are collectively referred to herein as “Users,” and the on-demand services provided by Service Providers to Customers shall be referred to herein as "On-Demand Services." As a User, you authorize Travtail to match you with a Service Provider or Servicer based on factors such as your location, the estimated time for the service, your destination, service category, and platform efficiency, and to cancel an existing match and rematch based on the same considerations. Any decision by a User to offer or accept On-Demand Services is a decision made in such User’s sole discretion. Each On-Demand Service provided by a Service Provider to a Customer shall constitute a separate agreement between such persons. </p>
						<h2 class="text-uppercase"> 
						Modification to the Agreement<br>
						</h2>	
						<p style="text-align:left">Travtail reserves the right to modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such modifications shall be binding on you only upon your acceptance of the modified Agreement. Travtail reserves the right to modify any information on pages referenced in the hyperlinks from this Agreement from time to time, and such modifications shall become effective upon posting. Continued use of the Travtail Platform or On-Demand Services after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. Unless material changes are made to the arbitration provisions herein, you agree that modification of this Agreement does not create a renewed opportunity to opt out of arbitration (if applicable).</p>
						<h2 class="text-uppercase"> 
						Eligibility
						</h2>	
						<p style="text-align:left">The Travtail Platform may only be used by individuals who have the right and authority to enter into this Agreement, are fully able and competent to satisfy the terms, conditions, and obligations herein.

You will be responsible for any breach of the above representations, warranties and/or this Agreement, and/or any attempt of the minor to disaffirm this Agreement. Furthermore, you hereby represent that you are fully authorized to execute this Agreement on behalf of yourself and all other parents or legal guardians of the minor rider.<br>

 </p> 
						<h2 class="text-uppercase"> 
						Charges<br>
						</h2>	
						<p style="text-align:left">As a User, you understand that request or use of Travtail Services may result in charges to you (“Charges”). Charges related using our platform to find Service Providers are addressed in the applicable Supplemental Agreement. Charges for Services include finder fees, credit card processing fees, service fee and other applicable fees, and taxes plus any tips to the Service Provider that you elect to pay. Travtail has the authority and reserves the right to determine and modify pricing by posting applicable pricing terms. You are responsible for setting the service fee and selecting Service Providers with the appropriate prices. You have the ability to change the price for the service before it is completed as agreed between you and the Service Provider. <br><br>
Fees and Other Charges.<br>
•	Service Fee. The service fee is the price you have provided and are willing to pay for the requested service. For service requests that involve the collection and acceptance of bids from multiple service providers, the service fee is the price that the service fee specified in their bid.<br>
•	Commission. We charge a default 4-15% commission on all jobs created on our platform. This fee is charged to only the service provider.<br>
•	Service Finder Fee. We charge an additional 5% on the service fee for all services requested on our platform.<br>
•	Tips. When a job is completed, you may elect to tip the Service Provider in cash or through the Travtail application. You may also elect to set a default tip amount or percentage through the app; Any tips will be provided entirely to the applicable Service Provider.<br>
General<br>
•	Facilitation of Charges. All Charges are facilitated through a third-party payment processor (e.g., First Data, Stripe, Inc., or Braintree, a division of PayPal, Inc.). Travtail may replace its third-party payment processor without notice to you. Charges shall only be made through the Travtail Platform. With the exception of tips, cash payments are strictly prohibited. Your payment of Charges to Travtail satisfies your payment obligation for your use of the Travtail Platform and Services. Travtail may group multiple charges into a single aggregate transaction on your payment method based on the date(s) they were incurred. If you don't recognize a transaction, then check your service receipts and payment history.<br>
•	No Refunds. All Charges for completed services are non-refundable. This no-refund policy shall apply at all times regardless of your decision to terminate usage of the Travtail Platform, any disruption to the Travtail Platform or Services, or any other reason whatsoever. If you cancel an “in-progress” Service (that is, the Service has been assigned to a Service Provider or you have selected a Service Provider from a bidding event), you will not receive refunds. If you need to reschedule the service for a different time, work directly with the Service Provider on rescheduling.<br>
•	Coupons. You may receive coupons that you can apply toward payment of certain Charges upon completion of a Service. Coupons are only valid for use on the Travtail Platform, and are not transferable or redeemable for cash except as required by law. Coupons cannot be combined, and if the cost of your service exceeds the applicable credit or discount value we will charge your payment method on file for the outstanding cost of the Service. <br>
•	Credit Card Authorization. Upon addition of a new payment method or each service request, Travtail may seek authorization of your selected payment method to verify the payment method, ensure the service cost will be covered, and protect against unauthorized behavior. The authorization is not a charge, however, it may reduce your available credit by the authorization amount until your bank’s next processing cycle. Should the amount of our authorization exceed the total funds on deposit in your account, you may be subject to overdraft of NSF charges by the bank issuing your debit or prepaid card. We cannot be held responsible for these charges and are unable to assist you in recovering them from your issuing bank.<br>
 </p>
						
						<h2 class="text-uppercase">
